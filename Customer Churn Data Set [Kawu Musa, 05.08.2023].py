# Part 1 - Data Pre-processing

## Step 1 - Importing Libraries and Data set
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sbn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#reading csv file using pandas and saving into a variable called 'data'
data = pd.read_csv('/content/Churn_Modelling.csv')

#previewing the top 5 rows in the dataset
data.head()

"""## Step 2 - Data Exploration"""

#Finding out the number of rows and columns in the dataset
data.shape

#Obtaining basic information about the dataset
data.info()

#Finding the column that has categorical (Non-numerical) data.
data.select_dtypes(include='object').columns

#Finding the number of column(s) that have/has categorical (Non-numerical) data.
len(data.select_dtypes(include='object').columns)

#Finding the column(s) that have / has numerical data.
data.select_dtypes(include=['float64','int64']).columns

#Finding the number of column(s) that have / has numerical data.
len(data.select_dtypes(include=['float64','int64']).columns)

#Summarising statistical information about the columns in the dataset.
data.describe()

"""## Step 3 - Dealing with Missing values"""

#Are there null values in the dataset?
data.isnull().values.any()

#The number of null values in the dataset?
data.isnull().values.sum()
